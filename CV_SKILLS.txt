Real-Time Fraud & Anomaly Detection System for Digital Payments
GitHub: github.com/Ndifreke000/Real-Time-Fraud-Anomaly-Detection-System

• Architected and developed a production-ready fraud detection system processing 
  1000+ transactions/second with sub-100ms latency
• Implemented hybrid ML approach combining Isolation Forest (unsupervised) and 
  XGBoost (supervised) with 70/30 ensemble weighting
• Engineered 11 fraud-relevant features including velocity analysis, behavioral 
  patterns, and geo-time inconsistency detection using Haversine formula
• Built RESTful API with FastAPI featuring 6 endpoints, API key authentication, 
  and comprehensive error handling
• Designed explainable AI system using SHAP values providing human-readable 
  explanations for every fraud decision
• Implemented cost-aware threshold optimization minimizing business impact of 
  false positives and false negatives
• Developed PII encryption system protecting sensitive user data (user IDs, 
  device IDs, IP addresses)
• Created priority-based alert system with analyst review workflow and status 
  tracking
• Utilized Redis caching with in-memory fallback for high-availability user 
  baseline management
• Designed scalable database schema with SQLAlchemy ORM supporting PostgreSQL 
  and SQLite
• Implemented comprehensive testing suite including unit tests and property-based 
  tests using Hypothesis
• Documented complete system architecture with requirements, design specifications, 
  and implementation guides
